# Understanding-the structure from the reciever-function a quantitative example beneath the Eastern part of the Himalaya

In order to image crustal features, Receiver Function (RF) analysis is a useful tool. The receiver function (RF) technique is a well established method to investigate the crustal and upper mantle structures based on three-component seismograms of teleseismic events(Langston 1977a;Vinnik 1977).The RF provides the signature of sharp seismic discontinuities and information about the shear-wave (S-wave) velocity distribution beneath the seismic station. The initial data are broadband seismograms of teleseismic waves rotated into vertical, radial and tangential (Z, R, T) components. After the deconvolution of the vertical component (Z) of the seismogram from the horizontal components (R, T), the source, instrument and ray-path effects are removed from the seismogram. In the case of a stack of homogeneous horizontal layers, the RF is a simple scaled version of the radial component of the seismogram with the P multiples removed (Ammon 1991).Proper rotation of seismograms is very important, especially in areas of complex structure.

Deconvolving the vertical (longitudinal) component from the horizontal (radial or tangential) component of teleseismic records the receiver-side structure response, referred to as the Receiver function. The process for estimating Moho depth using teleseismic receiver functions, as well as the accompanying uncertainty. By creating a receiver function stacking technique to convert time domain waveforms to depth domain, resulting in the most accurate estimates of crustal thickness and Vp/Vs ratio. Then, using this technique, can generate a map of Moho depth variation in the Eastern part of Himalaya using all accessible stations.

The size of an earthquake is determined by the fault's size and the amount of slip on the fault, both of which are difficult to estimate with a measuring tape because faults are hundreds of kilometres beneath the earth's surface. The use of seismogram recordings made on seismographs near the earth's surface to determine the magnitude of the earthquake. The magnitude of an earthquake refers to its size. Each earthquake has a specific magnitude. 

The following repo consists the codes I used, written in bash script to utilise SAC(Seismic Analysis Code) and GMT(Geological Mapping Tools) and the results obtained as a part of my Imsc thesis.
